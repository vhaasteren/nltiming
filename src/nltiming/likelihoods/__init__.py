"""Thin likelihood interfaces for Discovery and Enterprise.

``discovery_signals`` and ``enterprise_signal`` translate a bound
``NonLinearTimingModel`` (partition, ``ParameterSpace``, priors) into
Enterprise/Discovery signal objects. Timing priors are owned by
``ParameterSpace``; see the module docstrings in ``discovery`` and
``enterprise`` for how fallback cheat priors and
probability-integral-transform (PIT) bounds are handled.
